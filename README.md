# MysBrowse

This project is provided as a python script, and is free, if you paid for this, you've been scammed.

To use this program, you must have the Python programming language installed.
You can get it from "https://www.python.org", there is documentation on how to install it, so do not worry.

Since this program is provided as a .py file, or a Python script, you need to build the actual file into a .exe to use it.
To do this, you must install the "PyInstaller" from the pip file manager. Do this by typing in your terminal the command "pip install pyinstaller" after you've installed Python.
Then, you have to navigate to the directory in which you saved the .py file (or the browser). Do this by typing the command "cd (insert the path to your file here)".
Finally, to build it, you have to run the command "pyinstaller --onefile --windowed mysbrowse.py", you may replace "mysbrowse" with the actual file name.
