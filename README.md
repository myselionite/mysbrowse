# Instructions to Build the Executable

1. Ensure you have Python installed.

2. Unzip the project folder.

3. Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the unzipped project folder.

4. Run the `build.bat` file.

5. If the build is successful, you will find the executable in the `dist` folder.

Note: You may edit the code of the `build.bat` and the `mysbrowse.py`, however you need to edit some name-specific code in the `build.bat` file. Also, if someone sold you this, you've been scammed.

Also, if you use Linux or MacOS, fuck you.
